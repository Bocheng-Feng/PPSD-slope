# PPSD-slope
This repository provides toolkits for: 
1. measuring smooth slopes of density, velocity dispersion and PPSD
2. generate projected map of density, temperature and PPSD
in Gadget-2 snapshots with rockstar as halo-finder.

An example of [Concerto simulations](https://zenodo.org/records/14933624) can be run with:
```bash
python main.py
```
